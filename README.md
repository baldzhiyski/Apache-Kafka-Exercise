This repository is dedicated to exploring **Apache Kafka** and learning its core concepts. The goal of this project is to understand Kafkaâ€™s architecture, its messaging system, and how to work with it in real-world scenarios. The project includes examples and configurations for setting up Kafka with both Zookeeper and standalone mode, as well as demonstrating basic producer-consumer patterns.
